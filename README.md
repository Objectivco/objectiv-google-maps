# Objectiv Google Maps
Welcome to Objectiv's Google Maps plugin. We often need to display an interactive google map that displays markers for a client's list of locations. It can be quite a pain, so we created this plugin to help speed up the process when creating searchable maps.

Objectiv Google Maps will automatically pull from a selected post type and display the locations on a google map via shortcode. Users can search for locations by city using Google's autocomplete library.

If you would like to learn more or have questions you can get in touch with us at [@objectivco](https://twitter.com/objectivco).
